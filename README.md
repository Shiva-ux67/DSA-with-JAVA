#  Java + DSA Journey  

Welcome to my **Java + Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repo contains all the code I write while learning, practicing, and improving my problem-solving skills.

##  About This Repository  
This repository includes:

- ✔️ Java basics (loops, arrays, strings, functions)  
- ✔️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts  
- ✔️ Recursion practice  
- ✔️ Searching & Sorting algorithms  
- ✔️ Java DSA problems (easy → medium → hard)  
- ✔️ LeetCode problem solutions  
- ✔️ Pattern printing problems  
- ✔️ Important interview questions  

I update this repo daily as part of my learning journey.
